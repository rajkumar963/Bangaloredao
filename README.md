# Bangaloredao

> **Note:** I attempted to load your repository at `https://github.com/rajkumar963/Bangaloredao` but the GitHub file view returned a loading error while I was browsing. I was still able to see the repository file list (TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind config files and a `src/` folder). Based on that structure I created a comprehensive, ready-to-edit `README.md` below. If you want me to incorporate exact scripts, screenshots or code references from files in the repo, paste the file contents or allow me to access them and I’ll update the README accordingly.

---

## Project Overview

**Bangaloredao** is a frontend application built with a TypeScript + Vite toolchain and styled with Tailwind CSS. It appears structured for deployment on Vercel and uses modern tooling (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostCSS). This repository contains the app source in `src/` and configuration files for TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, PostCSS, Vite and Vercel.

This README is written to be a complete, user-friendly guide for developers who want to run, build, test and contribute to the project.

## Features (suggested)

> Add or edit this section to match what Bangaloredao actually provides.

* Responsive, mobile-first UI
* Type-safe codebase with TypeScript
* Fast dev server with Vite
* Utility-first styling using Tailwind CSS
* Optimized production build
* Opinionated ESLint + Prettier configuration

---

## Tech Stack

* Framework / Bundler: Vite (TypeScript)
* Language: TypeScript
* Styling: Tailwind CSS + PostCSS
* Linting: ESLint (config file present)
* Hosting: Vercel (vercel.json present)

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (version 16 or later recommended)
* npm (or yarn / pnpm — adapt commands below if you prefer)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajkumar963/Bangaloredao.git
cd Bangaloredao
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn
# pnpm install
```

---

## Development

A typical Vite + TypeScript project uses the following commands. If your `package.json` has different script names, replace them accordingly.

```bash
# start dev server
npm run dev

# run linting (if configured)
npm run lint
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL printed by Vite) to view the app.

---

## Production build

```bash
# build for production
npm run build

# preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist/` folder (default for Vite).

---

## Deployment (Vercel)

This project contains `vercel.json`, so it is ready to deploy to Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push the repository to GitHub (if not already pushed).
2. Import the repo in the Vercel dashboard.
3. Set environment variables (if any are required).
4. Trigger a deployment — Vercel will run the build command specified in `package.json`.

If you prefer the CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

## Coding & Linting

There is an `eslint.config.js` file in the repo. Typical lint scripts you can add to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "lint": "eslint --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx src/ --fix"
}
```

Add Prettier or Husky + lint-staged if you want commit-time formatting and checks.

---

## Environment variables

If the project uses environment variables, Vite expects them in `.env`, `.env.local`, or `.env.production` files with a `VITE_` prefix for client-side variables. Example:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Remember not to commit secrets.

---

## Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A simple contribution flow:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Make changes, ensure linting/tests pass.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description.

Consider adding a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with coding conventions and branch naming rules.

---

## Tests

No test files were visible in the repository listing. If you want to add tests, consider using:

* Jest + React Testing Library (for React)
* Vitest (works well with Vite + TypeScript)

Add example scripts:

```json
"test": "vitest"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

* If the dev server doesn't start, remove `node_modules` and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

* If Tailwind classes are not working, confirm `tailwind.config.js` `content` paths include `src/**/*` and `index.html`.

---

## License

I did not find an explicit license file in the repository listing. If you want this repo to be open source, consider adding an `LICENSE` file. The MIT license is a common choice.

Example: `LICENSE` — MIT

---

## Next steps I can help with

* Update this README to include exact `package.json` scripts and any project-specific commands if you paste `package.json` contents.
* Add badges (build, license, npm version, Vercel) and screenshots.
* Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

If you want me to commit this README directly to your GitHub repo, I can generate the file content and show it here (you can then copy-paste or I can open a PR if you give the necessary access).
